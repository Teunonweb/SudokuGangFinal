## Information

I completed this game in Spring of 2015 for my Object Oriented Programming course. It's very buggy at the moment
(For example, the AI doesn't always act as intelligently as I coded it)
but it is playable and looks nice, which, this being my first stab at a game, is something I am very proud of.
