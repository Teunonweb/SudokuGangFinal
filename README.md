## Information

I completed this game in Spring of 2015 for my Object Oriented Programming course. It was one of the first Java applications I created. It was made with a minimalistic style reminescent of retro arcade games like Asteroids. Front end created using JavaFX.

Fun Fact: The hardest part of this game to implement was the drag-and-drop controls to place the ship at the beginning of the game. JavaFX doesn't always give the best coordinates for where things are placed. Which is why when you look through the code at the drag-and-drop parts, you will find random numbers added and subtracted to the coordinates JavaFX provides, to find the real grid placement of the ships.
